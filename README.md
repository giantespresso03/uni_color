# Uni Color

### Used Game Engine: Unity
### Used Language: C#

**Project description:** Along with a group of friends, I started a private hackathon during summer break and took around 15 hours to create this application from scratch (including the drawings and background music). Our group primarily used Unity along with other softwares such as FL Studio and Microsoft Paint to collaborate efficiently.

The primary game mechanism is based on tilt control with acceleration, and the user has to avoid the differently colored astroids while crashing into the blue astroid in order to gain health. If the user doesn't crash into the blue astroid, the health slowly deplinishes and when the health bar reaches zero, the UFO explodes. We also added particle system so that the glowing stars in the background is randomly generated.
